Paper summary
-------------
The paper presents **Affe**: a functional programming language with a
substructural type system that is able to enforce protocols on correct usage of
resources. While many ideas in Affe overlap with Rust (like support for a
"borrowing" mechanism) there are some significant differences. Contrary to Rust,
Affe is a language in the ML-style with garbage collection and principal typing.
The paper presents various motivating examples, a formal presentation of the
Affe type system, the (instrumented) Affe operational semantics, and proofs of
type soundness and principal typing.

Comments for author
-------------------
I believe the paper addresses an important problem: substructural type systems
are promising (as shown by the success of the Rust language), but the design
space is huge and many aspects are yet to be explored---both in terms of
expressivity and the ability to minimize type annotations that need to be given
by the user. The Affe language as presented in this paper puts an interesting
new data point in this design space. Furthermore, the paper was quite pleasant
to read. However, I have some concerns:

- The use of "absolute" natural numbers to identify regions seems not modular.
  How do these absolute levels work in the presence of function definitions? I
  suppose you need a more "relative" notion of levels for that, since the levels
  in one function are unrelated to the levels in another function.
### DONE: Mentionned in the extensions
- It is very hard to get a grasp what kind of programming idioms can be type
  checked using Affe. Since Affe has been implemented, it expect a (small)
  empirical study to make sure that a large-enough class of programming idioms
  indeed work.
### Mentionned in the limitations/extensions, wrt control-flow sensitivity
- The example in Section 2.2 could be improved significantly.
  + It is not clear what is the key point of the example.
### DONE: added first paragraph
  + Conceptually the example is hard to grasp, which is exacerbated by the
    large amount of code.
### DONE: added some more explanation and structure
  + The code makes use of variants of the data structures that are presented
    in the paper (`Matrix`).
### DONE: added 1-2 sentences, explaining the minor difference
  + There are no types in the code. I understand types not needed due to
    principal type inference, but they would help the reader a lot to understand
    what's going on.
### DONE: added type signatures

Other questions to the author:

- What is the reason the borrow is fixed to `U` in the splitting rules `SuspB`
  and `SuspS` (page 10). It appears that this makes it impossible to reborrow
  an affine resource.
- Kinds are used to distinguish affine and unrestricted types, whereas Rust
  uses traits like `Copy` for that. For concurrency, Rust has the traits `Send`
  and `Sync` that indicate if types can be shared between threads. Is Affe's
  kind mechanism also powerful enough to keep track of things like `Send` and
  `Sync`?

Minor comments:

- p3: The type `withFile : path → (handle ⊸ r) → r` for opening a file in Linear
  Haskell is wrong, the `r` inside the closure needs to be unrestricted to
  guarantee that the handle cannot leak. The correct type is as follows:
  `withFile : path → (handle ⊸ unrestricted r) → r`.
### DONE
- p3: The phrasing of the contributions could be improved, some of the
  contributions overlap and other are not crisp. For example, "constraint
  simplification techniques" is not a contribution unless it's said why it's
  needed and what's novel about it. Also, what makes a soundness theorem
  "expressive"?
### DONE: I tend to agree with the remark about constraint
  simplification (but it's great that they are implemented)
- p5: Why are some operations in Fig 5 curried (e.g., `create`) and others
  uncurried (e.g., `get` and `set`)?
### DONE: I didn't see an issue and unified the example to all uncurried operations.
- p5: "After creation of the array, the presence of a borrow in the for loop
  prevents access to the “raw” resource inside the loop’s body." Maybe add that
  this means one cannot `free` the resource in the loop body, which would indeed
  be unsafe.
### DONE: correct - added
- p6: "the array elements are unrestricted" How is that evident from the code?
### DONE: follows from the use of get in the example and the (a : un)
  signature for get in Figure 2.
- p7: The type `PersistArray` has not been introduced.
### DONE: changed to CowArray
- p7: In `fold` the type `α array` is used, but `array` has not been introduced.
  I suppose it should be `α Array.t`?
### DONE: this was intended to be OCaml's 'a array type, but 'a
  Array.t also works.
- p8: "exclusive (A) or shared (U)". Maybe change that into "exclusive/affine
  (A) or shared/unrestricted (U)", then it would be clearer where the A and U
  come from.
### DONE
- p9: The functions `create`, `observe`, `update` and `destroy` appear out of
  thin air. On page 12 it's stated they were described in Section 2, but they
  have not been described there.
### DONE added some explanation
- p9: In order to reduce the conceptual overhead of the reader, it would be
  good to align the two examples in Sec 3.2. The first example could be
  annotated with regions as follows `f {| &^U x |} {[ &^U x |}`.
### DONE: The proposed simplification is incorrect, explanations are added in 3.2
- p10: Why have the `b` twice in the construct `&^b x : &^b (k,τ)` (Fig 7)?
  This is confusing, since it seems they are always the same.
### DONE
- p10: The construct `(&^b x : σ)` as used in Fig 8 does not align with the
  grammar in Fig 8. The RHS of `(&^b x : σ)` cannot be a type `σ`, but it should
  always be of the shape `&^b (k,τ)`.
### DONE: improved the notation
- p11: "Kind k restricts the lifetime of the borrow to the region (see Fig. 9)."
  Please refer to the specific rule in Fig 9 that demonstrates this.
### DONE
- p11: It would be illustrative to show the rule for reborrowing in Fig 9.
### DONE
- p12: Please explain in the beginning of Sec 3.4 why an instrumented semantics
  that keeps track of types/borrows/etc is needed.
### DONE
- p15: I would like to see some more information about the properties of the
  theory X that HM(X) (and the paper's extension thereof) need to guarantee
  principal typing.
### DONE: Added some of the properties in 4.3. We cannot state one of the property (cylindrid) because it requires talking about the ∃ operator on constraints, which we never mention.
- p15: In the beginning of Sec 4 it would be worth mentioning that it has been
  proved in the appendix that the extension of HM(X) still guarantees principal
  type inference.
### DONE
- p15: Input parameters are displayed in bold and blue, however, the variant
  of blue that is used is barely distinguishable from black. Please use another
  color.
### DONE. used another color ForestGreen and fixed a few typos from
  using \inp
- p21: I suppose "Affe is to combine ..." should be something like "The goal of
  Affe is to combine ...".
### DONE
- p21: Some text appears to be missing in footnote 3. What GHC proposal does
  the paper refer to? Where is it "attached"?
### DONE (the word "here" was a link --- expanded)
- p22: An omission in Sec 7.2 is the RustBelt project, which has developed
  a formal version of the Rust type system, and proved type soundness and
  data-race freedom of it and some of the Rust standard libraries.
### DONE

Paper summary
-------------
The article presents an extension of ML with a linear (and affine)
type system for safely using resources like user-managed
heap-allocated data. To enable an imperative programming style that
wouldn't work well with linear resource passing, the type system
enjoys a borrowing mechanism that can give read-only access to
resources or read-and-write access ("exclusive borrowing"). A central
concept in the type theory is a region that limits the scope of
borrowed resources. It is shown that regions can be inferred.

The design of the type system is motivated with two use cases: linear
arrays and a Sudoku solver that relies on hybrid data structures. Then
the static semantics (regions, constraints, type system) and a
big-step model are sketched. Next, the region inference algorithm is
presented and proved sound. Finally, type soundness and related work
are discussed. The type soundness proof is provided in the appendix
and the type system has been implemented in a publically available
prototype called Affe.

Comments for author
-------------------
Pros

 + prototype implementation available online

 + detailed type soundness proof (in the appendix)

 + region inference with soundness proof

Cons

 - presentation could be improved at places

 - complex type system and soundness theorem

 - only barely self-contained

There's a lot of material in this paper and I found that both
overwhelming and impressive. I feel overall positive about the paper
but also have some concerns.

First, this research area is a crowded space and there's a lot of
existing work (Rust, Linear Haskell, Quill, ...). I'm not familiar
enough with the details of these type systems to judge whether the
delta over existing work is significant and if the complexity of the
presented type system is justified. To some extent, I blame the
presentation (How about a comparison table or an implementing of a couple
of examples in different systems?) but the provided information should
be sufficient for experts.
### DONE: comparison matrix created

Second, the type system seems rather complex and I'm not convinced
that it would really help simplify working with linear and affine
resources. I understand that there are some benefits over resource
passing but there are trade-offs. This is probably best illustrated by
the type soundness theorem (my go-to place for getting some intuition
about a type system), which occupies three-quarters of page 19. This
is only the theorem; the proof is carried out on 20 pages in the
appendix.
### COMMENT: this will be available as an online appendix either on
arxiv or the DL. 

Again, the presentation could potentially be improved to address this
concern. For example, the overview section seems to (at least partly)
aim at showing off the expressivity of the type system with larger
examples instead of showing how it works with small code snippets. So
it didn't become clear to me at all why you need to distinguish
between borrows and exclusive borrows. What could go wrong, for
example, if the set function of the array module would use a
non-exclusive borrow type in the argument?

A minor issue was the claim (in the abstract) that expressions don't
require linearity annotations. Do you mean that linearity annotations
are only required for function calls (which are expressions)?

That said, the work does contain everything I expected: an
implementation, type rules, an operational model, and the type
soundness proof. Provided borrowing in an ML-style setting and the
other novelties listed in the intro are indeed a significant increment
over existing work, I'm in favor of accepting the paper.

A. I will champion accepting this paper.

Paper summary
-------------
The paper presents Affe, a novel extension to the ML type system that seamlessly integrates borrows à la Rust. Affe unifies and blends together borrowing, which enforces a well-nested lexical lifetime of borrows and classic ML features (polymorphism, unrestricted duplication) in a framework that retains much of the elegance and clarity we have come to expect from ML-like type systems. To that end, Affe proposes a novel combination of ingredients:
- an indexed kind system that is used as a technical device to enforce proper nesting of regions and prevent escaping
- bounded kind polymorphism to encode generality over the linearity of a type
- linearity over *values* rather than over *usage*
- a technical notion of "pre-borrow" (called "suspended borrow" in the paper) that allows decoupling environment splitting from actual borrowing -- this is a key innovation and allows tying borrows to the lexical structure of regions, and to kind (index) checking to enforce lexical nesting and prevent escaping.

This work comprises not only the design of the language, but also a proof of soundness, an extension of HM(X) to perform principal inference, proof of correctness of the algorithm, and an implementation written in OCaml, and uploaded online via js_of_ocaml to be tried (anonymously) on the Web.

Comments for author
-------------------
I very much liked this paper which presents an elegant and clear formalization for an *extension* of the existing classic ML system. Having seamless interaction between GC'd data and manually-managed linear resources integrated within the HM(X) framework is a novel and exciting contribution, which could lend itself to, say, an extension of OCaml for manually-managing parts of memory in performance-critical contexts. As such, I am very much in favor of accepting this paper.

The paper was well-written and pleasant to read. The formalization was convincing, keeping in mind that most of the proofs are paper proofs in a 42-page appendix. I was very much liked the novel and original use of index kinds with constraints, which turns out to be very expressive and allows expressing the well-formedness of regions and borrows. This makes rules simple and lexical nesting/escaping checks easy to express.

The perhaps central issue is that non-lexical borrows, a key feature of Rust, are not supported and are left to future work. This is, however, correctly acknowledged and the paper already contains enough of a framework to foster future research on how to add those to Affe. The other limitation is the lack of a mechanized proof: I spotted what seems like minor typos and/or notational puns in the various figures, but the design and ideas are novel and interesting enough that I don't consider this to be a deal breaker.

Another point that may be an issue is that by "baking in" lexical regions & borrows so deeply into the system, local relaxations might be hard to express. For instance, the `get` at line 201 seems overly restrictive in that it effectively restricts arrays to be arrays of unrestricted types, if you want to be able to access the elements (other than via a map or a fold). This makes the example somewhat less convincing -- in other systems, one might use existential quantification tricks or magic wands to express temporarily borrowing an *element* of an array before returning the element to the array. What would be the equivalent here? A new rule for extending the syntax of borrows with paths through structures and arrays? It would be good to discuss this and provide ideas / future directions.

Finally, a criticism that is often levied against Rust-like borrowing systems is that they do not lend themselves well to "escape hatches" and require the use of unsafe blocks. The canonical example is a doubly-linked list that must be somewhat assumed. Do you envision a similar discipline for your system where one might write, say, a doubly-linked list in regular GC'd ML, then assume an interface for it that exposes it as a resource? What would be the runtime semantics and would "forced freeing" be supported by the GC?

### Detailed remarks

In section 3.3, I found that earmarked borrows were a central idea in
this work, in that they allow to suspend borrow taking until a region
is encountered later on during type checking. Since the region is not
available at the time of environment-splitting (e.g. because in App
the region is to be found further down $e_1$), this allows deferring
the check later, when rule Region triggers. This is a departure from
the way linear type systems and/or borrows were previously modeled,
which deserves highlighting. It's also the key ingredient, because it
allows tying together the act of taking a borrow, the index `n` on the
lexical region (found in the expression tree) and enforce a bound on
the index of the kind of $\tau$. Perhaps more importantly, it allows
avoiding big compound rules. This is, in my opinion, worth emphasizing
more.

I think the inference status of regions was somewhat unclear for the
first few pages of the paper: insofar as I understand, regions are
elaborated (3.2) and are considered to not be part of the principality
result regarding type inference; they benefit from a special inference
procedure described in detail in appendix B. Without this context,
line 122 seem somewhat confusing, as "generally infers" seems to
contradict the earlier principal inference claim.
### DONE: "Affe elaborates regions automatically before type
inference. Alternatively, programmers may mark regions explicitly"

Fig 2: free operates on $\alpha: aff$ -- is this syntactic sugar for
$\forall \kappa. \forall (\alpha: \kappa). (\kappa \leq aff)
\Rightarrow \alpha t \to unit$? or is the subkinding generated
automatically as part of the constraints?
### DONE: yes. added sentence that makes this explicit.

I was somewhat confused by region inference: line 238 has two
occurrences of `&a` in a single region, which seems to contradict line
418, saying "the variable $x$ cannot occur in the region of $\&^bx$,
but then there's a word at line 461 about allowing merging two
regions?
### DONE: that was addressed in the text, but added "(recall that
shared borrows are unrestricted and may thus be duplicated)"

### Typos & focused remarks

- 70 ": It" (capitalization)
###(H) DONE

- 424: why was $\&^U$ in the first line of the code snippet upgraded to $\&^A$?
###(H) DONE (seems like a typo: changed &^U to &^A)

- 466: how is zero region per borrow allowed? we didn't hear this mentioned until this line
###(H) I'm not sure what is referenced here. Line 466 doesn't talk about borrows without regions.

- 499: in the fourth premise of rule Region, is $\tau \leq L_{n-1}$ sugar for $\tau: \kappa$ and $\kappa \leq L_{n-1}$?
###(H) Should we ignore this? It's clarified for $\sigma = \tau$ on line 515, before the discussion of the region rule on line 556, where it is again informally explained.

- 505: in the conclusion of BorrowBinding, the squiggly arrow does not have anything in superscript
###(H) I think the problem here is that we only show the squiggly rule for
###(H) bindings (which has no superscript) but talk about the rule lifted over
###(H) environments in the caption of the figure (Fig 9) and in the description of the
###(H) region rule (where we have a superscript).
###(H) Caption of Fig. 9: "... and borrowing rules (C ⊢ₑ Γ ⇝ˣₙ Γ')"
###(H) Current BorrowBinding rule in Fig. 9:
###(H) 
###(H)   C ⊢ₑ (bₙ ≤ k) ∧ (k ≤ b_∞)   b ∈ {U, A}
###(H)   —————————————————————————————————————–
###(H)   C ⊢ₑ [x : σ]^n_b ⇝ₙ (x % σ)^k_b
###(H)                     ^—— no superscript
###(H) 
###(H) We should probably either add a sentence about the lifting, or
###(H) alternatively inline the lifting into the BorrowBinding rule.
###(H) Do you think the following inlining would be a good idea and correct?:
###(H) 
###(H)   C ⊢ₑ (bₙ ≤ k) ∧ (k ≤ b_∞)   b ∈ {U, A}
###(H)   —————————————————————————————————————–
###(H)   C ⊢ₑ Γ, [x : σ]^n_b ⇝ˣₙ Γ, (x % σ)^k_b
###(H) 
###(H) In the appendix we only have `EBorrow*` rules for inference in Fig. 21,
###(H) so I'm not completely sure that I'm not missing something here for the
###(H) syntax directed version.

- 613: you write borrows (plural), how can there be multiple affine borrows? (if I understand affine to mean "strictly affine")
###(H) DONE: while I think the reviewer is correct, the whole sentence seems a bit
###(H) misleading. He's referring to the second sentence of the following paragraph:
###(H)   Addresses ρ are composed of a raw location ℓ, which is just a pointer into a
###(H)   store, and a stack of modifiers that indicates the borrows that have been taken
###(H)   from the original object. From the raw location, we may take affine borrows and
###(H)   reborrows. Once we have taken an unrestricted borrow (from a raw location or a
###(H)   borrowed one), then we can take further unrestricted borrows from it, but no more
###(H)   affine ones.
###(H) The second sentence may also be read as "we cannot take unrestricted borrows",
###(H) which is then directly contradicted in the subsequent sentence.
###(H) I've removed the second sentence and changed the paragraph as follow:
###(H)   Addresses ρ are composed of a raw location ℓ, which is just a pointer into a
###(H)   store, and a stack of modifiers that indicates the borrows and reborrows that have been taken
###(H)   from ℓ. Once we have taken an unrestricted borrow (from a raw location or a
###(H)   borrowed one), then we can take further unrestricted borrows from it, but no more
###(H)   affine ones.

- 645: what is $=_e$?

- 692: how come suspended bindings have an address that's different from their borrow? is there a key reason?

- 811: I was confused here: $\alpha_r$ seems to stand for the type of $(f\ x, x)$ per the constraint $(\beta\ast\alpha_x\leq\alpha_r)$ but at line 811 $\alpha_r$ seems to stand for the type of the whole abstraction

- 970: I am under the impression that this specific example could be reparenthesized as `(let a = &x in f a); g &!x` to work around the issue
