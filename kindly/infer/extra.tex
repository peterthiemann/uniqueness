\section{Type Inference}
\label{appendix:infer}

In this appendix, we provide the complete type inference rules
and show that our type inference algorithm is sound and complete.
The constraints rules are already shown in \cref{inference}.
Kind inference is presented in \cref{rules:kinding:full}
and the detailed treatment of let-bindings in
\cref{infer:let}.
The type inference rules are shown in \cref{rules:typing:full}.
The various theorems and their proofs are direct adaptations
of the equivalent statements for HM(X) \citep{sulzmann1997proofs}.


\subsection{Kind inference}
\label{rules:kinding:full}

  \label{rules:kinding}
\end{figure}

We write $\inferK{(C,\unif)}{{\inP\E}}{{\inP\tau}}{k}$ when type $\tau$ has kind $k$
in environment $\E$ under constraints $C$ and unifier $\unif$.
$\inP\E$ and $\inP\tau$ are the input parameters of
our inference procedure.
We present the kind inference algorithm as a set of rules in
\cref{rules:kinding}.
Higher-kinds are not generally supported
and can only appear by looking-up the kind scheme of a type constructor,
for use in the type application rule {\sc KApp}.
Type variables must be of a simple kind in rule {\sc KVar}.
Kind schemes are instantiated in the {\sc KVar} rules by creating
fresh kind variables and the associated substitution.
{\sc KArr} and {\sc KBorrow} simply returns the kind of the primitive
arrow and borrow types.
The $\operatorname{normalize}$ function is used every time several constraints
must be composed in order to simplify the constraint and return a most general
unifier.


\subsection{Generalization and constraints}
\label{infer:let}

% So far, constraints have only been composed of a list of kind inequalities.
% The internal language of constraints used for inference is in fact
% richer.
% To illustrate this, we show the inference rule for let-bindings
% in \cref{rule:infer:let}.
The {\sc Let} rule combines several ingredients previously seen:
since let expressions are binders, we use $\Weaken$ on the bound
identifier $x$. Since let-expressions contain
two subexpressions, we use the environment splitting relation,
$\bsplit{C_s}{\Sv}{\Sv_1}{(\Sv_2 \Sdel{x})}$. We remove the $x$ from
the right environment, since it is not available outside of the expression
$e_2$, and should not be part of the returned usage environment.

As per tradition in ML languages, generalization is performed
on let-bindings.
Following HM(X), we write $(C_\schm, \schm) = \generalize{C}{\E}{\tau}$
for the pair of a constraint and a scheme resulting from
generalization. The definition is provided in \cref{rule:infer:let}.
The type scheme $\schm$ is created by quantifying over all the appropriate
free variables and the current constraints.
The generated constraint $C_\schm$ uses a new projection operator,
$\Cproj{x}{D}$ where $x$ can be either a type or a kind variable, which
allow the creation of local variables inside the constraints.
This allows us to encapsulate all the quantified variables in the global constraints.
It also reflects the fact that there
should exist at least one solution for $C$ for the scheme to be valid.
\citet{DBLP:journals/tapos/OderskySW99} give a detailed account
on the projection operators in HM inference.
