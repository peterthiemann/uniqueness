\section{Type inference}

We now formulate type inference for the \lang language. Our inference technique is based on the HM(X) framework~\citep{DBLP:journals/tapos/OderskySW99} which
presents how to merge Hindley-Milner type inference for let-polymorphism and
constraint solving. We first present our constraint language, we then show
our slight extension of HM(X) that support a kind system and affine types.

\subsection{Constraint language}

We consider $\mathcal C$ the set of constrains.
The grammar of constrains, presented
in \cref{grammar:constraint}, follows the traditional HM(X) formulation
with conjunctions,projections and type inequalities. The only new
element specific to our approach are kind equalities.
Entailment is noted $\entail{C}{D}$, where $D$ is a consequence of the
constraints $C$. The entailment rules are provided in \cref{rules:entail}.

  \begin{align*}
    C ::=&\ \Cleq{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\ |\ \Cleq{k_1}{k_2}\ |\ C_1 \Cand C_2\ |\ \Cproj{\alpha}{C}
  \end{align*}

\end{figure*}


\paragraph{Solved forms}

The set of solved forms, noted $\mathcal S$,
is the set of constraints than can be used inside
type and kind schemes. $\mathcal S$ is composed only of kind
inequalities \emph{over variables}. For convenience, if $C\in\mathcal S$, we
note $C$ as a list of kind inequalities: $\Cleq{\kvar_i}{\kvar_{i'}}^n$.
\TODO{Extend the properties of solved forms}


We consider the existence of a function $\normalize$ which takes
a constraint in $\mathcal C$ and a unifier $\psi$ and returns a constraint
in solved form $C'$, and an updated unifier.


\subsection{Kind inference}

We note $\inferK{(\unif,C)}{\E}{\tau}{k}$ the fact that type $\tau$ has kind $k$
in environment $\E$ with constraints $C$ and unifier $\unif$. From an
algorithmic point of view, $\E$ and $\tau$ are the input parameters of
our inference procedure.

\section*{Todo}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add type constructors
\item Properly ensure that it respects HM(X) (cylindric, \dots)
\item Show principal type inference:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Principal constraint system
  \item Regular constraint system: $\Ceq{\tau}{\tau'} \implies \fv{\tau} = \fv{\tau'}$.
  \item Solved forms are in simplified form.
    $C\in S, \entail{C}{\Ceq{\tau}{\tau'}} \implies \entail{}{\Ceq{\tau}{\tau'}}$.
  \end{itemize}
\item Show equivalence with the logic-based system.

\end{itemize}


\begin{lemma}
  Without loss of generality, we can consider that
  kind inequalities in satisfiable constraints
  are only done on kind variables. 

  \begin{proof}
    Consider the constraint $\Cleq{k}{k'}\Cand C$.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If $k$ and $k'$ are both constants, it can be removed.
    \item If the constraint is $\Cleq{\kvar}{\kaff}$ or $\Cleq{\kun}{\kvar}$, it can be removed.
    \item If the constraint is $\Cleq{\kvar}{\kun}$ or $\Cleq{\kaff}{\kvar}$, we
      can substitute $\kvar$ by its value in $C$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
