\section{The \lang language}

\subsection{Syntax}

The syntax of \lang is presented in \cref{grammar} and follows
traditional ML languages with let bindings.
Data constructors are introduced by $\introK{K}{e}$ and eliminated
with by $\elimK{K}{e}$.
Types are composed of type variable $\tvar$, parameterized type constructors
$\T{t}$ and arrow types annotated with a kind, noted $\tau \tarr{k} \tau$.
Kinds can be either a kind variable $\kvar$, affine $\kaff$ or unrestricted $\kun$.
Type schemes and kind schemes are guarded by a set of constraints.

Environments are composed of value and type bindings, along with type
declarations. Type declarations, of the form
$\tydecl{t}{\kschm}{K}{\tau}$, introduce both a new type constructor $\T{t}$ and
a data constructor $K$.
