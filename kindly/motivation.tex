\lang{} supports the resource-passing style
common in functional encodings of session types (e.g.,
\cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/Padovani17}; see also
\cref{sec:session-linearity} in the supplement) as well as other
functional resource handling. But it really shines
when manipulating mutable resources like buffers or connection pools
using a mix of functional and imperative programming styles.
%
To support this usage pattern of linearity, \lang{} relies on
the notion of borrowing \cite{DBLP:conf/popl/BoylandR05}. Our first
example of linear arrays demonstrates simple borrowing and
imperative programming; the second example demonstrates reborrowing
and the interaction between closures and borrowing by implementing a
Sudoko solver based on a hybrid copy-on-write data structure; the
third example demonstrates advanced uses 
of regions with iterators on linear values and the low-level
primitives needed to implement them.
Further examples are available in \cref{sec:extra-example}.

The API for mutable linear arrays (\cref{sig:array})
aims to safely handle manual allocation and
deallocation of arrays that may contain affine or linear elements.
A program would first use @create (n, v)@ to create
an array of size @n@ initialized with value
@v@. The value @v@ must be unrestricted as it is duplicated to
initialize all array elements.
To @free@ an array the elements must be affine. Thanks to subkinding,
the type of @free@ is pleasingly simple: any type @'a@ whose kind is
less than or equal to @aff@ is acceptable. 
The @length@ function is always applicable.
The @get@ function is only applicable
if the element type is unrestricted as one element is duplicated.
To @set@ an array element displaces the previous content, which must
be at least affine.

The @map@ function can transform arrays with arbitrary elements. In 
particular, it can turn unrestricted elements into linear (affine)
ones. It takes a borrow of the input array and returns a newly created
output array. As @free@ing requires affine elements, we provide the
@iter@ function which takes a
suitable finalizer and an array with arbitrary elements, which is
consumed. Indeed such an iteration is the only way to free an array
with linear elements. A real-life
API would provide a combination of @map@ and @iter@ as a
``destructive'' map that consumes its input array. Assuming a uniform
representation, such a destructive map might be implemented by
in-place update.

To manage the different kinds of accessing the array we distinguish between constructors, destructors,
observers, and mutators.
Constructors and destructors like @create@ and @free@ manipulate the whole
array. %As with channels in \cref{sec:session-linearity},
The constructor
@create@ yields a linear resource which is consumed by @free@.
During the lifetime of the array resource @a@, we can split
off \emph{shared borrows} @&a@ that provide a read-only
view or \emph{exclusive borrows} @&!a@ for read-write views.
Observer functions such as @length@ and @get@ expect a shared borrow
argument, mutator functions such as @set@ expect
an exclusive borrow.

Each borrow is tied to a region whose lifetime is properly
contained in the lifetime of the resource.
In a region, we can split off as many shared borrows of a resource as
we like, but we can take only one exclusive borrow. In a
subsidiary region, we can take shared borrows of any
borrow or we can take an exclusive borrow of an exclusive borrow from an
enclosing region. Borrows are confined to their regions. Inside the region,
shared borrows are unrestricted (@un@) whereas exclusive
borrows are affine (@aff@).

Using the API 
we can create an
array of Fibonacci numbers in an imperative coding style, as shown
in \cref{ex:fibo}.
%
After
creation of the array, the presence of a borrow in the for loop
prevents access to the ``raw'' resource inside the loop's
body. In particular, the resource cannot be freed through a
borrow. \cref{ex:array:get} contains two shared borrows 
in the same expression which forms a region by itself (recall that
shared borrows are unrestricted and may thus be duplicated). These borrows
are split off the exclusive borrow used in \cref{ex:array:set} which
belongs to the next enclosing region corresponding to the loop body.
The whole array can be returned in \cref{ex:array:return} because  the
borrows are no longer in scope.
%
More precisely, here is is an annotated excerpt with regions explicitly
marked by braces @{| ... |}@:
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=3]
  for i = 2 to n - 1 do {|
    let x = {| get (&a, i-1) + get (&a, i-2) |} in(*@\label{ex:array:region:get}*)
    set (&!a, i, x)
  |} done;
\end{lstlisting}

One region consists of the header expression of the @let@ in
\cref{ex:array:region:get}. It is contained in another region
spanning the body of the @for@ loop. \lang guarantees that borrows
never escape the smallest enclosing region. It employs a system of
\emph{indexed kinds} like @aff_r@ and @un_r@ where
$r$ is a positive integer that corresponds to the lexical nesting
depth of regions. For instance, the type of @&!a@ in
\cref{ex:array:set} has kind @aff_1@ whereas the type of
@&a@ in \cref{ex:array:region:get} has kind
@un_2@ and the typing of the inner region is such that types with
kind indexes greater than or equal to $2$ cannot escape.
In the example, borrows cannot escape  because they are consumed
immediately by @get@ and @set@.

\subsection{Iterators and Regions}
\label{tuto:vector}

% We have seen that borrows are limited to a region.
In the examples so far, regions do not appear in type signatures.
But for certain programming idioms, we want to extend the scope of a
region across a function boundary.
For instance, how should we fold on an array of linear objects?
Here is a first attempt at the type of a fold function:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
val fold : ('a:'k) => ('a -> 'b -{'k}> 'b) -> 'a Array.t -> 'b -{lin}> 'b
\end{lstlisting}
This type puts no restrictions on the element type of the array, but
it requires the @fold@ function to consume the array and all its
elements. The last function arrow is linear because the array type (from
\cref{sec:imper-progr}) is linear. 

If we want to work on borrows of linear and affine resources, then the
typing gets more involved because
we must make sure those borrows are not leaked in the result.
We obtain the following signature for @bfold@, the borrowing fold operation:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
val bfold : ('b:'k),('k <= lin_r) => (&(aff_r1,'a) -> 'b -{aff_r1}> 'b) -> &('k_1,'a Array.t) -> 'b -{'k_1}> 'b
\end{lstlisting}

The folded function receives a shared borrow of the element in the array.
The typing of the callback ensures
that this borrow is neither captured nor returned by the function.
%
This encapsulation is implemented with a universally quantified \emph{kind index variable} $r$.
The signature prescribes the type @&(aff_r1,'a)@ for the
shared borrow of the resource with an affine kind at region nesting $r+1$. The return
type of the callback is constrained to kind @'k <= lin_r@. The
important part of this constraint is the $_r$ index, which ensures
that the callback cannot return the borrowed argument from the more
deeply nested scope. 
%
The input of the fold is a shared borrow of the array,
which ensures that we have the right to share borrows of the inner content and
make multiple concurrent folds.

As an easy example, we fold over an array of files
@all_files : File.t Array.t@ to compute the sum of their sizes:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
let total_size_of files = bfold (fun f s -> File.size f + s) files 0
let total_size = total_size_of &all_files
\end{lstlisting}

This approach is not sufficient if we want to mutate the elements of
the array during iteration.
To this end, we need to take an exclusive borrow of the structure to iterate
on:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
val iter_mut : (&!(aff_r1,'a) -> unit) -> &!('k_1,'a Array.t) -> unit
\end{lstlisting}

While the distinction between mutable and immutable iteration functions
seems unfortunate, it is typical of
programming with borrows and is also present in the Rust standard library.
It enables the programmer to explicitly state how different iterations
may be composed and optimized.
It also enables different implementations such as
using parallel iterations in the immutable case.
\lang's region variables ensure that the content iterated on can never
be leaked outside of the iteration function.
This pattern is essential in many use cases of linearity such
as pools of linear objects (see \cref{tuto:pool}).

To close this discussion, let's see which primitives are needed to implement
functions like @bfold@ and @iter_mut@. The naive sequential implementations of
both functions boil down to a loop over the index range of the array:
\begin{flushleft}\vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec bfold_helper f a z i =
  if i < 0 then z
  else bfold_helper f &&a (f (get_sb &&a i) z) (i-1)
let bfold f a z =
  let l = length &&a - 1 in
  bfold_helper f &&a z l
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec iter_helper f a i =
  if i < 0 then ()
  else (f (get_eb &&!a i); iter_helper f &&!a (i-1))
let iter_mut f a =
  let l = length &&a - 1 in
  iter_helper f &&!a l
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
\end{flushleft}
Observe that we are proposing two different primitives
\begin{itemize}
\item
  @get_sb : &('k, 'a Array.t) -> int -{'k}> &('k, 'a)@ \\to get a
  shared borrow from a shared borrow of an array and
\item
  @get_eb : &!('k, 'a Array.t) -> int -{'k}> &!('k, 'a) (* Unsafe! *)@
\\to get an
  exclusive borrow from an exclusive borrow of  an array.
\end{itemize}
These primitives have the same underlying implemention (the same as
@get@ from \cref{sec:imper-progr}). Their types arise from the
intuition that the borrow of a structure should entitle to borrows of
its substructures, roughly, the borrow of an array could be considered as
array of borrows.
However, only @get_sb@ is safe: the shared borrow of the array entitles us to
obtain shared borrows for the elements \emph{in the same region} as
the shared borrow for the array freezes the array inside the
region. This freeze extends to the elements because 
lifetime of the array fully overlaps with the lifetime of its
elements. 
Considering @get_eb@, we see that we may obtain \emph{two different
exclusive borrows} of the same array element inside a region. Clearly,
the exclusive borrow for the element should live in a nested region
where the array is not accessible. Hence, the safe alternative is
to use a different function for obtaining borrows of elements
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
with_eborrow : ('b:'k),('k <= lin_r) => &!('k_1,'a Array.t) -> int -> (&!(aff_r1,'a) -> 'b) -{'k_1}> 'b
\end{lstlisting}
Hence, the helper function for @iter_mut@ should read like this
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec iter_helper f a i =
  if i < 0 then ()
  else (with_eborrow &!a i f; iter_helper f &!a (i-1))
\end{lstlisting}
which also explains the occurrence of @aff_r1@ in the type of
@iter_mut@.

We conclude that borrows of datastructures create the need for
differently typed access functions that are tailored for different use
cases. The argumentation whether such an access function is safe is
sometimes subtle and gives rise to nonobvious types.
